Personal Curated list of Slack bots

I am a serial [Rails Developer](http://ThomParkin.com) and insatiable [Parahacker](http://parahacker.com) who loves building new things.

Here are my latest ‘Slack-bot’ creations, along with my favorites made by others.

  - [Slack Bible Bot](https://github.com/ParkinT/bible-bot/blob/master/README.md)
    - Biblical inspiration available anytime you need it
  - [BusinessSpew (BS) Bot](https://github.com/ParkinT/bs-bot/blob/master/README.md)
    - Generate sentences, paragraphs or pages of [**BusinessSpew**](http://bs.leveragedsynergies.com) instantly
  - [Tic-Slack-Toe](https://github.com/ParkinT/tst-bot/blob/master/README.md)
    - An updated version of the old paper-and-pencil game
  - [SlackBot Starter Kit](https://github.com/ParkinT/tst-bot)
    - Turn **your** clever idea into a SlackBot
  - [Slack Scheduler]() does not [yet] have a public repository.  But you can [add it](https://gist.github.com/ParkinT/f557bf8fe0a06f2e625d48c3640135b1) to your Slack Team and use it now
